# Dog vs Cat Classification Project

## Introduction

This project is designed to classify images of dogs and cats using a deep learning model. The trained model can accurately predict whether a given image is of a dog or a cat. While the original dataset is not included in this repository, the trained model and the application are provided for demonstration purposes.

## Project Structure

- `cat_dog_classifier_pipeline.pkl`: Contains the trained model file.
- `Classifier.py`: Main application code for making predictions.
